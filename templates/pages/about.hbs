<h1>About Find Robot Parts</h1>

<p><strong>Find Robot Parts</strong> was created by members of <a href="https://burncoatrobotics.org/" target="_blank">FIRST Robotics Competition Team 1735, The Green Reapers</a> from Worcester, Massachusetts.</p>

<p>We built this site to solve a problem we kept running into as students and mentors: finding the right part for a robot shouldn't take hours of searching across multiple vendor sites. With so many new components available every season, it’s easy to miss what’s out there—or to lose time comparing options. <strong>Find Robot Parts</strong> brings everything together in one searchable place so teams can discover, compare, and build faster.</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>Can you list prices?</h3>
<p>No — prices change frequently and can vary from vendor to vendor. Instead, we link directly to each supplier so you always see the most accurate, up-to-date information.</p>

<h3>Why isn’t a specific product listed?</h3>
<p>We try to include every relevant part we can find, but we’re human (and occasionally over-caffeinated). Some common reasons something might be missing:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Products with multiple versions may be grouped under a single entry.</li>
	<li>If we couldn’t find a reliable vendor link, we didn’t list it.</li>
	<li>There are thousands of components, sometimes we simply miss one.</li>
	<li>Occasional late-night Mountain Dew powered oversight.</li>
</ul>
